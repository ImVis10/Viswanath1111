- 👋 Hi, I’m @Viswanath1111
- 👀 I’m interested in Sofware architecture, designing scalable systems, Software security, Blockchain(DeFi to be precise).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to develop DApps on Blockchain using Solidity, how to secure Blockchain protocols/applications.
- 💞️ Currently I'm in a learning phase on Web3. Would love to colloborate towards that in the future. But currently I'd love to contribute to any Web2 project(primarily Backend) or writing up of any technical articles.
- 📫 How to reach me - TBD
